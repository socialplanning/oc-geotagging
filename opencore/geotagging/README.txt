GEOLOCATION
============

This package enhances opencore to allow storing and retrieving
geospatial coordinates, and getting georss feeds on containers.

Initially we're implementing this for the opencore people and projects
folders.

For tests of the underlying configuration that makes this all work,
see configuration.txt.

For tests of the viewlets that will be provided as plugins for
opencore, see browser/README.txt.

(There used to be tests in this file, but all the functionality is
currently in the viewlets.)
